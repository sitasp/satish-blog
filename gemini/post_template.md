**Content Guidelines:**

*   **Tone:** Write in a personal, informal, and educational style. Imagine you're explaining a technical concept or project to a friend.
*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Introduction:** Start by defining a problem, a goal, or a question.
    2.  **Body:**
        *   Present a step-by-step guide, a tutorial, or a narrative of your experience.
        *   Use headings (`##`, `###`) to organize sections.
        *   Include code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ` ```bash`).
        *   Show command outputs where applicable.
        *   Use lists, bold/italic text, and links to improve readability.
    3.  **Conclusion:** End with a summary, "Final Thoughts," or a call to action.
*   **Formatting:**
    *   Use Markdown for formatting.
    *   Separate major sections with `---`.
