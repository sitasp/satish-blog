      <description>&lt;p&gt;After my first taste of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) with the PicoCTF challenge, I was hooked. It was a relatively straightforward introduction, and it left me wanting to learn more. This post documents my journey of diving deeper into SSTI, from studying the theory to solving a more complex challenge on Root-Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by consuming as much information as I could find on SSTI. Here are some of the resources I found most helpful:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently dove into the world of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) and it was a blast! I decided to tackle a PicoCTF challenge to test my skills, and it turned out to be a fantastic learning experience. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my journey from finding the vulnerability to getting the flag, as it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-ssti&#34;&gt;What is SSTI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSTI, or Server-Side Template Injection, is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into a template, which is then executed on the server. This can lead to serious consequences, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
