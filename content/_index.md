# Welcome to My Scribbles

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Satish Patra**, a passionate software developer with **2.5 years of experience** in the **fintech industry**. Currently, I work at **Sapper AI**, where I help deliver cutting-edge fintech solutions to major banking organizations in the US. 

Previously, I contributed to **Paytm**, gaining hands-on experience in building and deploying end-to-end software systems. My expertise lies in creating scalable backend systems, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless user experiences.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, sharing knowledge, and, of course, scribbling my thoughts here.
